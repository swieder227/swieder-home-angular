#### HTML5
I code semantic, reusable, HTML markup. My weapon of choice (text editor) is [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/), because it has many shortcuts for quickly writing HTML code. 

#### CSS3 + Sass
CSS applies style and visual design to a webpage. CSS3 transition and animations, in combination with SVG, bring the UI to life. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), a CSS Preprocessor, provides efficiency macros and extensibility to vanilla CSS.

#### AngularJS 
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a Javascript MVC Framework for creating Single Page Applications. I utilize Angular for discrete HTML templates and modular javascript components. 

#### gulp
[gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a build process tool. It automates my workflow by compiling Sass, applying [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) prefixes to all CSS, running localhost servers with [livereload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-connect), and so much more! 

#### Design in Browser
I do the majority of design directly in the browser, editing using the Chrome Dev Tools, and testing performance in the Network panel.
